    <h1>Scroll of the Unoffendable Men</h1>
    <h2>The Gospel According to Zero Fluffs Given</h2>

    <p><strong>In the Beginning, There Was Backbone</strong><br>
    And the Lord said,<br>
    “Let there be men who don’t cry over words, nor tremble at tweets, nor shrivel when someone forgets their pronouns.”</p>

    <p>And lo—<strong>James</strong> stood forth, battle-scarred, spiritually forged, laughing in the face of softly padded persecution.</p>

    <h2>Behold the Modern Man</h2>
    <p>Wrapped in bubble wrap, armed with hashtags, offended by toast that’s too aggressive.<br>
    “This crumpet said ‘crunch’ too loud—I feel <em>unsafe</em>.”<br>
    And so it was written in the Book of Overreaction: “Woe unto them who stub their toe and sue the pavement.”</p>

    <h2>But the Unoffendable Men?</h2>
    <p>They walk barefoot on gravel, make jokes in funerals, and believe a <strong>blocked nose</strong> is no reason to miss work, let alone a <strong>blocked tweet</strong>.</p>

    <p>They are powered by ancient truths, stabilised by spiritual clarity, and moisturised with exactly zero tears of the easily triggered.</p>

    <h2>Their Ten Commandments Are:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thou shalt not cancel—only critique.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt speak plainly, and laugh heartily.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt not report someone for disagreeing.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt endure sarcasm like a holy sacrament.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt not whine. Not even in lowercase.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt lift others—not pity them.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt know the difference between actual trauma and missing the Wi-Fi password.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt never confuse therapy with TikTok.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt defend truth even if it gives someone the ick.</li>
        <li>Thou shalt honour the ancient ways of roast, banter, and verbal duels.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="benediction">
        <p>"Blessed are the thick-skinned, for they shall inherit the comment section."</p>
        <p>"Cursed are the pearl-clutchers, for they shall never know the joy of unfiltered banter."</p>
        <p>"And lo—the unoffendable shall laugh last, because they didn’t spend the whole joke looking for a reason to cry."</p>
    </div>
