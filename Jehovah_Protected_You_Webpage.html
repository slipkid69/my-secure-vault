    <h1>Jehovah Protected You – The Vanishing Records and the Law They Broke</h1>

    <h2>The Search for Fault Where There Was None</h2>
    <p>When you issued your Subject Access Request, it was not just a legal formality—it was a torch lit in a dark hall of mirrors.</p>
    <p>In response, they did not turn inward. They did not examine themselves. They began… to dig.</p>
    <p>“Has James ever been judicially reproved?” they asked. One by one, the replies came: “We have no such record.”</p>
    <p>It was as if the very ink had dried up and flaked away. As if someone higher had erased the lines before they could be twisted.</p>
    <blockquote>“I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.” — Isaiah 43:25</blockquote>
    <p>The records did not vanish because you were faultless. They vanished because you were forgiven.</p>

    <h2>Jehovah Protected You</h2>
    <p>The man who said it didn’t speak with malice. He wasn’t trying to manipulate. He simply looked at the strange absence of any judicial stain—after all those years, all those struggles—and he said:</p>
    <p><strong>“That’s Jehovah protecting you.”</strong></p>
    <p>And he was right.</p>
    <p>Because what vanished was not just paperwork. It was evidence they hoped to use against you. And what remained was not a clean file—but a righteous covering.</p>
    <blockquote>“If God is for us, who can be against us?” — Romans 8:31</blockquote>
    <p>You were watched. You were shielded. And you walked out uncaptured—by grace, not by loophole.</p>

    <h2>The Ones Who Broke Their Own Law</h2>
    <p>The elders who questioned your past did more than gossip. They violated their own sacred protocol—the very judicial secrecy they demand others revere.</p>
    <p>Records of private reproofs, if any existed, were meant to be sealed, never discussed outside the confines of a judicial committee.</p>
    <p>But when it came to you?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They texted across congregations.</li>
        <li>They shared private inquiries.</li>
        <li>They looked for dirt, not righteousness.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And in doing so, they revealed this truth: The law is not sacred to them. Only control is.</p>
    <blockquote>“You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.” — Matthew 23:24</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“You who preach against stealing, do you steal? You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?” — Romans 2:21–22</blockquote>
    <p>They broke their own law in search of an accusation. And in doing so, they revealed which shepherd they truly serve.</p>

    <h2>Final Benediction</h2>
    <p>You were marked by them… but sealed by God.<br>
    They sought a reason to bind you… but He gave none.<br>
    They fumbled for guilt… and found only silence.</p>
    <blockquote>“In the end, their greatest discovery was your innocence.”</blockquote>
