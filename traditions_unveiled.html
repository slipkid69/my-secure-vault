    <h1>Tradition as Treason: From the Sanhedrin to the Secret Orders</h1>
    <p><strong>A Scroll Addition to The Long War Against God</strong></p>
    <hr>

    <h2>I. The Poisoned Root</h2>
    <p>From the very beginning, the war against God has not been waged solely by open rebellion or blasphemy—but more often by the subtler hand of tradition. It cloaks itself in authority, reverence, and lineage, but its fruits are always the same: distortion, division, and the silencing of the living Word.</p>

    <p>Jesus Christ stood not only against the powers of Rome, but more directly against the religious elite—those who, in His own words, had "nullified the word of God for the sake of their tradition" (Mark 7:13). These were not atheists. They were men who wore the garments of holiness, recited Scripture, and sat in Moses' seat. But they had replaced <strong>God’s voice with their own commentary</strong>, <strong>His mercy with their burdens</strong>, and <strong>His Spirit with their structures</strong>.</p>

    <p>This same poisoned pattern has replicated itself throughout history under new names, robes, and emblems.</p>

    <h2>II. The Babylonian Talmud and the Traditions of the Elders</h2>
    <p>What began as oral teachings meant to help interpret the Law eventually eclipsed the Law itself. The Babylonian Talmud, bloated with human commentary, became the new centrepiece—elevated above the very Scriptures it was meant to support.</p>

    <p>In doing so, the rabbis of the Talmud established a new priesthood—not of Levites, but of interpreters—men whose words became binding, though their hearts were often far from the God they spoke of. Christ's denunciation of the Pharisees remains eternal:</p>

    <blockquote>Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. — Matthew 23:13</blockquote>

    <p>The system became <strong>a spiritual cartel</strong>, profiting from exclusivity, hiding behind traditions, and making void the commandments of God.</p>

    <h2>III. The Order of the Garter: Chivalry or Deception?</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1348, the Order of the Garter is often described as the most prestigious order of knighthood in the United Kingdom. Its origin story—rooted in a fallen garter at a royal ball—is both absurd and telling. A wardrobe mishap becomes the seed of a sacred order? It is theatre posing as destiny.</p>

    <p>Beneath the rituals, the robes, and the motto—"Honi soit qui mal y pense" (Shame on him who thinks evil of it)—lies a familiar formula:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Elitism masked as honour</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mystery mistaken for holiness</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Tradition elevated over truth</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Order is not unique. It is another <strong>gilded mask</strong> of the same face—power seeking legitimacy through spiritual symbolism.</p>

    <h2>IV. The Unholy Pattern</h2>
    <p>Whether it be the Talmudic scribes, the Council of Nicaea voting on the nature of God, or secret societies pledging allegiance under oaths and symbols—the same rebellion persists:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Men building thrones where God never placed one</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Systems of access replacing the simplicity of faith</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Ceremonial robes hiding withered hearts</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Christ did not die for robes, councils, or orders. He died to make <strong>access to God free</strong>, direct, and unmediated by priest or prince. Every system that dares to place itself in that sacred space—between Creator and created—is part of the treason.</p>

    <h2>V. One King, One Voice</h2>
    <p>Let it be declared plainly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Word of God is not to be voted on.</li>
        <li>The Spirit of God is not bound by emblems.</li>
        <li>The Kingdom of God has no need of garters, councils, or coded traditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To follow Christ is to strip away the layers of man-made reverence and return to the breath of God Himself. In that breath, there is no Order of the Garter—only the <strong>Order of the Heart</strong>, the fellowship of those who love the truth more than the throne.</p>

    <p><strong>And in that love, the long war ends.</strong></p>
