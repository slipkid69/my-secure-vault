<h2>Welcome to the Clarity Patrol Database</h2>
<p>This satirical document outlines the enforcement methods, cultural shifts, and ideological mandates of Constable Percival Oinkington and Sergeant Lucinda Grit. Any resemblance to real persons, events, or dystopian realities is purely coincidental… allegedly.</p>

<h2>Key Incidents and Ideological Enforcement Log</h2>
<p>All incidents, phrases, and pseudo-legal occurrences are intended for humour, criticism, and cultural observation. For instance, see: “Sir, you're under arrest for Excessive Patriarchal Posturing (EPP).”</p>
<p>Or the infamous quote: “You don’t have a badge, but I’ve got a vag.”</p>
<p>Enforcement powered by vague notions of empowerment and Keir Starmer’s fictional Ministry of Cultural Alignment (MCA).</p>
