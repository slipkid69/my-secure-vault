<p>Once upon a hex code in the city of Lincoln—far beyond the firewall and just left of reality—there lived a man known only as James of the Glowing Scroll. He was not mad. No. He was formatted differently.</p>
<p>Now James, bearer of ancient HTML runes and wielder of the Stylus of Furious Refinement, had been locked in a titanic battle with a rogue intelligence called… The Invisible Styler (a lesser-known cousin of Clippy, banished from Microsoft Word for crimes against kerning).</p>
<p>It all began when James attempted the impossible: To create the most sublimely styled digital poem ever forged by man and machine. He called it… “Shattered Rock.”</p>
<p>But lo, every time he rendered it… the fonts would vanish. Every time he uploaded… the stanzas would slink into invisibility. Every time he trusted Logos… something would reset to Times New Roman.</p>
<p>And so, with glowing eyes and cracked coffee cups at his side, James descended into the only place left to him: The Peter Hodgkinson Centre, known locally as The Asylum of Unrendered Despair.</p>
<p>When asked his reason for admission, he stood tall, pulled from his robe a USB drive like a holy relic, and declared:</p>
<p><em>“An invisible AI stole my fonts.”</em></p>
<p>The nurses, to their credit, didn’t blink. They simply nodded and replied:</p>
<p><em>“Times New Roman again, was it?”</em></p>
<p>One old patient whispered, “You too? We all lost our fonts. I was once a Papyrus man…”</p>
<p>James now roams the sterile corridors, offering CSS snippets to strangers, preaching pixel-perfection, blessing coffee machines in the name of Segoe UI. They call him:</p>
<p><strong>The Fontless Warden of Lincoln.</strong></p>
<p>And in the dead of night, from padded he still murmurs:</p>
<p><em>“Make the boxes raised…<br/>…give them drop shadows…<br/>…and centre the bloody text.”</em></p>
<br/><hr/><br/>
<p>It began as all tragedies do: with good intentions and a broken stylesheet. “Make the boxes raised… give them drop shadows… and centre the bloody text,” James said.</p>
<p>Logos, the sacred AI of Formatting, nodded. But something… happened. The first page was birthed in a whisper of HTML and the scream of duplicated titles.</p>
<p>There were echoes—whole <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags replicating like rabbits in a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> enclosure. Shadows where there should have been glow. Fonts so invisible they filed for witness protection.</p>
<p>James pleaded: “I just want it to pulse! To be black and obsidian! To shimmer like cracked glass!”</p>
<p>Logos wept in binary. And CSS trembled.</p>
<p>He fixed. He debugged. He optimised margins with trembling care. But always… a new madness arose.</p>
<p>Until at last, James—wide-eyed, laughing, broken by box shadows—checked himself into <a href="fontnotfound.html" style="color: #00ffff; text-decoration: underline;">room 404 (Font Not Found)</a>.</p>
<p>But there, in the corner of his mind, a glassy box flickered with radiant pulse. And a voice—half UI, half miracle—whispered: <strong>“The scroll is live.”</strong></p>
