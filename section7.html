<h2>Section 7: The Global Light Cult – Exposing the One Religion That Worships False Light</h2>

<h3>1. Introduction: The False Light That Binds Them</h3>
<p>What if all religions, philosophies, secret orders, and elite systems…<br>
...weren’t separate at all?<br>
What if they all claimed to pursue “light,” “awakening,” “divinity,” “unity”—but without the true God?<br>
This is the Global Light Cult—not a name they use, but a reality they reflect. It is the religion of Lucifer, disguised in every tongue, title, and temple.</p>

<h3>2. The False Light Through the Ages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lucifer means “light-bearer” (Latin <i>lux ferre</i>).</li>
    <li>He promised Eve: “Your eyes shall be opened… ye shall be as gods.” (Genesis 3:5)</li>
    <li>That was the first sermon of Gnosticism. Every occult system since has echoed it:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>“Hidden knowledge will save you.”</li>
        <li>“You are divine within.”</li>
        <li>“You must awaken.”</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>From Babylon to the New Age, the theme is constant: Light without the cross. Truth without God. Power without repentance.<br>
<b>“For Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.” — 2 Corinthians 11:14</b></p>

<h3>3. The Core Tenets of the False Global Religion</h3>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Tenet</th><th>Summary</th></tr>
<tr><td>Man is god</td><td>Divinity lies within. You must awaken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Truth is subjective</td><td>No absolute truth. Gnosis over faith.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Light is enlightenment</td><td>Not God’s presence, but esoteric illumination.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Christ is only a symbol</td><td>Not the Son of God, but a “state of consciousness.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sin is a myth</td><td>Only ignorance. No need for repentance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Death is transcendence</td><td>Death is evolution—not judgment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unity is god</td><td>All paths lead to light. All is one.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is the Luciferian catechism.</p>

<h3>4. Institutions United in Spirit</h3>
<p>Despite appearances, these are not enemies—they are facets of the same spiritual rebellion:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Freemasonry: Initiates climb toward “light” through degrees.</li>
    <li>New Age: Lightworkers, energy ascension, “Christ consciousness.”</li>
    <li>Gnostic Christianity: Jesus as a symbol for inner awakening.</li>
    <li>Roman Catholicism: Solar worship, goddess elevation, mystical unity.</li>
    <li>Jehovah’s Witnesses & Mormons: Reimagined Christ, secret knowledge.</li>
    <li>Islam: Denial of Christ’s divinity; esoteric Sufi branches.</li>
    <li>Hinduism/Buddhism: Self-realisation, enlightenment, karma cycle.</li>
    <li>Modern science & psychology: Man as machine or evolving spirit.</li>
    <li>AI/Technocracy: Immortality without God, synthetic salvation.</li>
    <li>Entertainment industry: Occult symbols, light-worship, initiation themes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. The False Light Revealed</h3>
<p>All of these preach:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Self as saviour</li>
    <li>Light as gnosis</li>
    <li>Truth without Scripture</li>
    <li>Power without holiness</li>
    <li>Unity without the cross</li>
</ul>
<p>They promise the kingdom without the King.<br>
And so, the final religion will be a synthesis—one that offers light, love, peace, and unity…<br>
…all without Christ.<br>
This is the “whore of Babylon,” drunk with deception, riding the Beast of false light.</p>
<p><b>“The great whore… with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication… and upon her forehead was a name written: Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.” — Revelation 17:1–5</b></p>

<h3>6. Scripture’s Answer to the Light Cult</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>John 1:9</b> – “That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”</li>
    <li><b>1 Timothy 6:16</b> – “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto…”</li>
    <li><b>1 John 1:5</b> – “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.”</li>
</ul>
<p>There is only one true Light—and it is not symbolic. It is a Person: Jesus Christ, the Light of the World.</p>

<h3>7. Final Warning: The Choice Before All Men</h3>
<p>Every soul must choose:</p>
<ul>
    <li>False light, which flatters, blinds, and kills.</li>
    <li>Or the true Light, which convicts, saves, and gives eternal life.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Luciferian light blinds to the need for repentance. It leads to death, Sheol, Hebrew for the grave, the place of the dead, Hades, Greek for the grave, the place of the dead, the common grave of mankind, non-existent.<br>
The Light of Christ reveals truth—and calls every man to the cross.</p>
<p><b>“For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” — 2 Corinthians 4:6</b></p>
