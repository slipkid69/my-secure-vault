        <h1>The Linguistic Relics of Eden</h1>
        <p><em>A sacredly comedic scroll exploring divine phonetics, postlapsarian dialect loss, and esoteric vowel retrieval techniques.</em></p>

        <div class="scroll">
            <p><strong>In the beginning was the Word</strong>, and it was pronounced flawlessly… until Adam sneezed mid-syllable, and humanity’s phonetics fell from grace.</p>
            <p>Theologians have long speculated about the <strong>Lost Tongue of Eden</strong>—the original divine language spoken by Adam and Eve before Babel turned vowels into vendettas. But what most scholars fail to mention is this:</p>
            <blockquote>The rest of the mouth has yet to be discovered.</blockquote>
            <p>Fragments of Edenic lips were reportedly found etched into the limestone of Mount Misinterpretation. Meanwhile, a group of rogue linguists claim to have unearthed the uvula of Enoch, though most agree it's just a cleverly carved raisin.</p>

        <h2>Recent Discoveries from the Echohaven Institute of Pre-Babelian Semiotics:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Nasal Cavity of Noah</strong>: May explain why ancient Hebrew often sounds like you're praying through hay fever.</li>
            <li><strong>The Wisdom Teeth of Methuselah</strong>: Still speaking Aramaic in their sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>The Tickle of the Divine Epiglottis</strong>: Caused holy laughter in four prophets and one donkey.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Famous Translations from the Lost Tongue:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>“Let there be light”</strong> — originally pronounced <em>“Bzzzzt!”</em></li>
            <li><strong>“It is not good for man to be alone”</strong> — possibly mistranslated from <em>“Bro needs backup.”</em></li>
            <li><strong>“Who told you that you were naked?”</strong> — likely a euphemism for <em>“Put on some fig, lad.”</em></li>
        </ul>
