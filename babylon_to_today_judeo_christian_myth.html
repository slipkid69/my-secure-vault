    <h1>From Babylon to Today: The Fabrication of Judeo-Christianity</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>1. The Fall of Judah and the Babylonian Captivity</h2>
    <p>In 586 BCE, the Babylonian empire under Nebuchadnezzar invaded Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and carried the people of Judah into exile (2 Kings 25:1–21). During this time, the Israelites were exposed to Babylonian culture, language, astrology, mysticism, and oral traditions.</p>
    <p>Many scholars and religious historians note that this period marked the beginning of significant shifts in how the Torah was interpreted, eventually giving rise to the “traditions of the elders” which Jesus later condemned (Mark 7:1–13).</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. The Rise of Pharisaic Traditions</h2>
    <p>Upon returning from exile, a new class of religious teachers emerged: scribes and Pharisees. While Ezra reintroduced the Law (Nehemiah 8), others began adding fences around it—man-made rulings meant to “protect” the Torah. These oral laws evolved over centuries into what later became known as the Mishnah and, ultimately, the Talmud.</p>
    <p>Jesus identified these traditions as corrupting the word of God: <em>"You have made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition" (Matthew 15:6).</em></p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Jesus and the Condemnation of Rabbinic Religion</h2>
    <p>Jesus, though from the tribe of Judah, openly challenged the religious authorities of His time. The scribes and Pharisees had created an entire religious system—based not on Mosaic Law, but on oral traditions from Babylonian influence.</p>
    <blockquote>
        “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men…” — Matthew 23:13
    </blockquote>
    <p>He never aligned Himself with the religion of His day. Instead, He called it a “brood of vipers” and accused them of replacing God’s law with their own rulings. This system would become Rabbinic Judaism after the Temple was destroyed in 70 CE.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. The Destruction of the Temple and the Rise of Rabbinic Judaism</h2>
    <p>With the Temple destroyed by Rome in 70 CE, sacrificial worship—the heart of biblical Judaism—ended. What remained was a purely oral and interpretive tradition. The Pharisees, not the Sadducees or Essenes, emerged as the dominant voice and formalised the Mishnah (~200 CE), and later, the Babylonian Talmud (~500 CE).</p>
    <p>This post-Temple faith bore little resemblance to the Israelite religion of Moses and Aaron. It became legalistic, mystical, and rabbinically controlled.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Christianity’s Early Separation and Opposition</h2>
    <p>The early Christian church (Acts 2–7) was comprised largely of Jews who accepted Jesus as Messiah. However, mainstream Judaism quickly rejected them, and persecution followed (Acts 7:54–60, 13:45). Paul declared: <em>"They please not God, and are contrary to all men" (1 Thessalonians 2:15).</em></p>
    <p>There was no fusion of belief. Christianity affirmed Jesus as the fulfillment of the Law (Matthew 5:17), while Rabbinic Judaism denied Him.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. The Term “Judeo-Christian” Emerges</h2>
    <p>The phrase “Judeo-Christian” did not exist in the ancient world. It was popularised in the 20th century, particularly after World War II, as part of a Western political effort to unite Christians and Jews under shared cultural values against atheistic communism.</p>
    <p>While the two traditions share certain moral laws (e.g., Ten Commandments), they are theologically irreconcilable on key doctrines such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The identity of Jesus (Messiah or false prophet)</li>
        <li>The role of grace vs. law</li>
        <li>The nature of God (Trinitarian or strictly monotheistic)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Modern Confusion and Spiritual Consequences</h2>
    <p>By blurring the lines between biblical Christianity and post-Temple Rabbinic Judaism, the term “Judeo-Christian” distorts truth. Jesus did not come to uphold the traditions of the elders—He came to fulfill the Law and bring in a new covenant (Hebrews 8:6–13).</p>
    <blockquote>
        “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.” — Colossians 2:8
    </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>8. Conclusion: A Distinction That Must Be Maintained</h2>
    <p>The twelve tribes of Israel, the Babylonian exile, the rise of Rabbinic Judaism, and the mission of Christ must be clearly understood. To collapse them into a single term like “Judeo-Christian” is to ignore history, Scripture, and spiritual truth.</p>
    <p>Jesus was the Son of God, not a disciple of the Talmud. He exposed the Babylonian traditions, fulfilled the Law, and founded a covenant of life and light—utterly distinct from the religious system that denied Him.</p>
