<div class="scene"><p>Clad in techno-samurai robes with a glowing baton of behavioural compliance, Klaus Schwab stands atop the Alpine stage, arms raised like a conductor of global compliance.</p><p>Behind him: a pulsating LED screen that flashes messages like "Happiness is Mandatory" and "You Will Own Nothing... and You Will Dance."
    </p><p>From the shadows, influencers, bureaucrats, and tech billionaires begin to shuffle in rhythm—entranced, obedient. Even the most rebellious politicians now step in sync, drawn by the hypnotic trance of the Piper's beat.</p>
<p>Each bass drop erodes another liberty. Each laser flash updates your social credit score. Klaus Schwab in futuristic robes, glowing baton in hand, leading a hypnotised conga line of tech bros, influencers, and confused politicians through the Alps…</p>
<p>Every bass drop wipes another civil liberty.</p>
<p>Every laser pulse reprograms a social credit score.</p>
<p>Behind him, a massive LED screen reads:<br/><strong>“Happiness is mandatory.”</strong><br/><strong>“Klaus Schwab: Techno Überlord at Club Davos”</strong></p>

:

“When your ideology is all posture and your soul never showed up for the recording.”
<p><em>“Yuu vill own nozzing… und yuu vill dance!”</em><br/><em>"Yuu vill eat zee bugs... und yuu vill like eet," </em> whispers the Piper. 🎤 Dr. Jordan Rectumson: Cries at the drop of a truth. Often drops the truth.

🧠 Ben "Shapiro-Protocol" Shoutalot: Speaks faster than thought. Thinks slower than breath.

💪 Joe "Alpha Omega Elkman" Rogan: Sponsored by mushrooms, testosterone, and rogue dumbbells.

🔊 Alex J. Thundercheeks: Yells at clouds. Yells at the idea of clouds. Might be a cloud.

🧘 Russell Branded in Confusion: The guru of hyperlinked sentences. Knows the meaning of life, but forgot where he put it.

💻 Sam Disassociation Harris: The AI that forgot it was pretending to be human.

👁️ Yuval “Delete Free Will” Harari: Thinks your soul is outdated firmware. Wants your thoughts uploaded before supper.</p>
