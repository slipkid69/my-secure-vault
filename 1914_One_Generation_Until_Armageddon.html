        <h1>1914: One Continuous Generation Until Armageddon</h1>
        <p>
            Many interpretations have been given to Jesus' words in <strong>Matthew 24:34</strong>: 
            <em>“Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.”</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>The Watch Tower Society’s Evolving Interpretation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early View:</strong> The generation alive in 1914 would not die before Armageddon.</li>
            <li><strong>Later View:</strong> Overlapping generations of “anointed ones” who lived during or after 1914.</li>
            <li><strong>Current View:</strong> Two overlapping groups of anointed ones whose collective lifespan extends the generation until the end.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This redefinition has caused confusion, and appears to stretch the natural meaning of “generation.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>A More Scriptural Understanding</h2>
        <p>
            The term <span class="highlight">"generation"</span> in Scripture is not always a fixed number of years. Consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deuteronomy 32:5</strong> — “They are a perverse and crooked generation.”</li>
            <li><strong>Psalm 95:10</strong> — “For forty years I was angry with that generation.”</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 12:39</strong> — “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These examples show “generation” can refer to a kind or era of people, not just a time span.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>The 1914 Generation — A Prophetic Era</h2>
        <p>
            The generation that began in 1914 marks the start of a prophetic time period. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>World War I and global unrest</li>
            <li>False prophets and increasing lawlessness (<strong>Matthew 24:11-12</strong>)</li>
            <li>Earthquakes, famines, and pestilences</li>
            <li>Rise of nation against nation</li>
            <li>The preaching of the good news worldwide (<strong>Matthew 24:14</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is not about a numerical generation, but a <strong>spiritual and prophetic one</strong> that will last until Armageddon.</p>

            “The generation from 1914 is one continuous generation until Armageddon. It is not measured by years, but by prophecy and fulfillment.” — A Reflection from James

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Rather than clinging to a numeric or institutional interpretation, we can embrace a consistent, scriptural view:
            <span class="highlight">“This generation”</span> began with 1914 and encompasses the prophetic season of the end times—
            lasting until the return of Christ and the conclusion of this world system.
