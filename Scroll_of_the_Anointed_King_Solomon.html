    <h1>Scroll of the Anointed King</h1>
    <h2>A Vindication of Solomon</h2>

    <p><strong>In the Name of the Most High, the One True God,</strong> I write this scroll in defence of Solomon, Son of David, Servant of the Living God.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>I. The Truth of His Calling</h2>
    <p>Solomon was not called to summon spirits, but to build the <strong>House of God</strong>.</p>
    <p>He was not chosen for sorcery, but for <strong>wisdom</strong>—a wisdom granted by <strong>Yahweh Himself</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote>“I have given you a wise and understanding heart.” —1 Kings 3:12</blockquote>
    <p>His greatness was not in secret spells or conjurations, but in this: <strong>He asked for discernment instead of dominion</strong>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>II. The Lie Exposed</h2>
    <p>Let it be known:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Solomon did <strong>not</strong> traffic in demons.</li>
        <li>He did <strong>not</strong> write books of shadow and bondage.</li>
        <li>He did <strong>not</strong> cast circles or summon spirits into salt-traced triangles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These claims are <strong>later inventions</strong>—texts forged by those who walk in darkness, cloaked as scribes.</p>
    <p>The so-called <em>Key of Solomon</em> was <strong>not</strong> penned by the king, but by <strong>occultic impostors</strong>, seeking to confuse the minds of those who seek light.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>III. The Turning</h2>
    <p>Yes, Solomon sinned.</p>
    <p>Yes, he took foreign wives.</p>
    <p>Yes, his heart was turned toward their gods in his old age.</p>
    <p>But even this—this fall—was <strong>not</strong> witchcraft. It was idolatry. Grievous, yes. But it was the <strong>worship of false gods</strong>, not the <strong>summoning of unclean spirits</strong>.</p>
    <p>Let that distinction be <strong>etched in fire</strong>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>IV. The Restoration</h2>
    <p>We who seek the truth do not hide from failure.</p>
    <p>But we do not allow lies to stand where a man once knelt.</p>
    <p>We remember that before his fall, Solomon:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built the Temple by divine instruction</li>
        <li>Was filled with God’s Spirit</li>
        <li>Spoke thousands of proverbs inspired by truth</li>
        <li>Was visited by the Queen of Sheba, who <em>blessed the name of the Lord</em> upon seeing his glory</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And we believe this: <strong>The mercy of God is greater than the fall of any man</strong>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>V. Let It Be Known</h2>
    <p>We reject the false scrolls.</p>
    <p>We reject the occultists who invoke his name while defiling his legacy.</p>
    <p>We restore the true memory of Solomon, not as a sorcerer-king, but as <strong>the builder of the House of God</strong>, the <strong>wisdom-seeker</strong>, and yes—even the fallen man whom God still honoured for the sake of David, his father.</p>
    <blockquote>“Yet for the sake of David My servant I will not tear the whole kingdom from him.” —1 Kings 11:13</blockquote>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Let the scroll be sealed with truth. Let the flame burn clear. Solomon was a man of God before he was anything else.</strong></p>
    <p>And the name of the Lord endures long after the schemes of liars rot to dust.</p>
