<p>🜏 5.2: Babylon and the Birth of Sorcery<br/>Babylon was the womb of occult science:<br/>• Ziggurats reaching to heaven<br/>• Astrology used to summon and interpret spirits<br/>• Sacred prostitutes invoking divine possession<br/>• Idols believed to house demonic intelligences<br/>In Daniel’s time, Babylon’s priesthood included:<br/>• Magicians<br/>• Astrologers<br/>• Sorcerers<br/>• Chaldeans<br/>These were not party tricks—these were governmental advisors.<br/>And their legacy remains today, rebranded and digitised.</p>
<p>🜏 5.3: Witchcraft Through the Ages<br/>In Ancient Egypt:<br/>• “Heka” was the spiritual force believed to power the universe<br/>• Magicians invoked gods to perform miracles<br/>• Pharaoh’s magicians replicated Moses’s miracles by demonic power (Exodus 7:11)<br/>In Ancient Greece:<br/>• The Oracle at Delphi received visions from the “god” Apollo—believed by many to be demonic channeling<br/>• Hecate, goddess of magic, crossroads, and necromancy, was widely worshipped<br/>In the Middle Ages:<br/>• Witch hunts emerged not because witches weren’t real—but because they were<br/>• Grimoire texts (e.g. The Key of Solomon) spread spells and demonic invocations<br/>• Black masses, blood rituals, and pacts with demons were whispered throughout Europe<br/>Today:<br/>• Modern witchcraft (Wicca, New Age) presents itself as peaceful, nature-loving, and divine feminine energy<br/>• But many of its rituals trace directly to ancient sorcery:<br/>◦ Binding spells<br/>◦ Invocation of spirits<br/>◦ Moon-phase ceremonies<br/>◦ Reversal of Christian symbols<br/>The rebellion is now a fashion trend.</p>
<p>🜏 5.4: The Rise of Black Magic and Ritual Abuse<br/>While some dismiss it as fantasy, black magic persists in shadows:<br/>• Blood rituals, animal/human sacrifice, and ritual abuse are real and often cloaked in mystery or mockery<br/>• High-level practitioners exist in secret societies, often cloaked under the veil of charity or philanthropy<br/>• Dark rituals are used not merely to ‘cast spells’ but to forge demonic covenants and create soul fracture in victims<br/>Satan doesn’t care if the world laughs.<br/>He just wants the rituals done.</p>
<p>⚠️ Section Explanation &amp; Warning<br/>Witchcraft is not empowerment.<br/>It is enslavement through enchantment.<br/>It begins as curiosity.<br/>It ends in obsession, possession, or despair.<br/>“But I’m not doing it to hurt anyone,” they say.<br/>But rebellion is never harmless.<br/>And spiritual portals, once opened, do not close without a price.<br/>Witchcraft’s real danger lies in its deceptive beauty:<br/>• It mimics divine femininity<br/>• It speaks of balance, nature, harmony<br/>• But behind the veil is darkness, decay, and death</p>
<p>💡 Scriptures That Bring Clarity<br/>“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” — Exodus 22:18<br/>“There shall not be found among you… a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.” — Deuteronomy 18:10–11<br/>“And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee… for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.” — Revelation 18:23<br/>“Many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them…” — Acts 19:18–19<br/>Black Magic &amp; Witchcraft – The Serpent’s Power in the Hands of Man<br/>1. The Origin: From Eden to Babylon<br/>Witchcraft and black magic are not new. Their roots go back to the Garden of Eden, when Satan, the serpent, whispered the first great lie:<br/>“Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” – Genesis 3:5<br/>This was the birth of occultism: seeking forbidden knowledge, power apart from God, and divinity through rebellion.<br/>• Nimrod and Babylon (Genesis 10–11): The post-Flood world consolidated rebellion at Babel, building a tower to heaven and forming the first unified occult empire. Nimrod, Cush, and Semiramis become the archetypes of false gods and goddesses in every major occult system since.<br/>“Babylon is fallen… she became the habitation of devils…” — Revelation 18:2<br/>This is where astrology, enchantments, necromancy, idol worship, and blood rituals began.</p>
<p>2. Ancient World Systems<br/>Witchcraft and sorcery flourished in ancient civilisations:<br/>• Egypt: The magicians of Pharaoh replicated Moses’ signs through dark arts (Exodus 7:11–12). Egypt venerated Thoth, god of magic, and practiced ritual death, curses, and divination.<br/>• Canaan: The Canaanite religions involved child sacrifice to Molech and sexual rites to Asherah. God commanded Israel to completely destroy these nations because of their witchcraft.<br/>• Greece and Rome: Practiced necromancy, consulted oracles, invoked Hecate, the triple goddess of the underworld. Witches and seers were part of statecraft.<br/>“There shall not be found among you… one who uses divination, or is an enchanter… or a witch.”<br/>— Deuteronomy 18:10–12<br/>These practices were not merely misguided—they were abominations.</p>
<p>3. Black Magic Defined<br/>Black Magic is the intentional use of spiritual power to manipulate, control, harm, or destroy.<br/>Key aspects:<br/>• Curses and hexes<br/>• Blood rituals – animal and human sacrifice<br/>• Binding spells – controlling someone’s will<br/>• Demonic invocation – inviting spirits to possess or act on behalf of the practitioner<br/>• Sympathetic magic – voodoo dolls, effigies, sigils<br/>• Divination – tarot, astrology, crystal scrying<br/>Unlike folk magic or “white” magic (a false distinction), black magic is overtly destructive, often directed by demonic forces in exchange for power.</p>
<p>4. Witchcraft Through the Ages<br/>Medieval &amp; Renaissance Europe<br/>• Witch trials (e.g., Salem, Pendle, Würzburg) often reflect societal hysteria, but genuine practitioners existed.<br/>• The rise of the Grimoire tradition: spellbooks like The Lesser Key of Solomon and The Picatrix—manuals of summoning and spirit contact.<br/>• The Church, though compromised at times, rightly condemned sorcery as satanic rebellion.<br/>Modern Resurgence<br/>• 19th century: Theosophy (Blavatsky), Golden Dawn (Crowley), and rise of ceremonial magic<br/>• 20th century: Wicca (Gerald Gardner), Neopaganism, chaos magic<br/>• Pop culture: Normalisation of witchcraft in TV, film, music, and fashion—especially among youth<br/>• Internet occultism: TikTok witches, YouTube spellcasters, Discord covens</p>
<p>5. Witchcraft in the Bible<br/>• 1 Samuel 15:23 – “Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft…”<br/>• Galatians 5:20 – “...idolatry, witchcraft, hatred…” (Works of the flesh)<br/>• Acts 8:9–24 – Simon the sorcerer tried to buy the Holy Spirit’s power<br/>• Acts 19:19 – Believers burned occult books worth 50,000 silver coins<br/>Witchcraft is not “harmless energy work.” It is rebellion, manipulation, and spirit invocation that God hates.</p>
<p>6. Why It Is Dangerous<br/>• Demonic Attachment: Opens gateways to possession, depression, and torment<br/>• Loss of Free Will: The deeper one goes, the more control is yielded<br/>• Counterfeit Power: Promises autonomy, but delivers bondage<br/>• Deception: Often marketed as healing, feminism, or self-empowerment—but it is rooted in Lucifer’s lie</p>
<p>7. The False Light of Wicca and “White Magic”<br/>Wicca claims to be a benevolent nature religion, but its gods are rebranded pagan deities: Cernunnos, Diana, Gaia, and so forth.<br/>• The “Law of Threefold Return” and “Harm None” ethic give the illusion of moral high ground<br/>• Wicca still practices:<br/>◦ Moon worship<br/>◦ Casting circles<br/>◦ Invoking spirits<br/>◦ Use of spellbooks and grimoires<br/>• It replaces God with Goddess—an inversion of divine truth<br/>“For such are false apostles… transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.<br/>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.”<br/>— 2 Corinthians 11:13–14</p>
<p>8. The Scriptural Counter-Witness<br/>• Isaiah 8:19 – “Should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?”<br/>• Leviticus 19:31 – “Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them.”<br/>• Revelation 21:8 – “...sorcerers… shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone…”</p>
<p>Spiritual Warning<br/>Witchcraft is not empowerment. It is enslavement to a spirit that pretends to be light, but leads only to death.<br/>The Holy Spirit is not summoned, manipulated, or chanted into presence—He is given by grace, not control. True power is found only in surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/></p></p>
