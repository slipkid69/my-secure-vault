<h1>The Sauceress of En-Dior</h1>
<h2>Saul the Teabag &amp; the Last Steep</h2>

<p>
        Once infused with promise, Saul the Teabag had lost his flavour. Once the bold brew of the people, now left soggy
        and discarded in the saucer of doubt. The Great Brewer Above had steeped him for the last time.
    </p>
<p>
        Desperate for a sign, Saul teetered to the dusty edge of the pantry to consult one long forbidden—the Sauceress of En-Dior.
        Her cracked porcelain gleamed with prophecy, her handle worn from centuries of forbidden pours.
    </p>
<p>
        “Bring me a spirit,” Saul begged, his string frayed. “One who knew the recipe for righteousness.”
        The Sauceress lifted her lid, and from her depths rose steam thick with memory… and biscuits.
    </p>
<p>
        But the aroma summoned more than the past. It summoned Boilzebub—the Scalding Spirit, a demon kettle who whistled with fury.
        “WHO DARES DISTURB MY SIMMER?” he roared, shaking cupboard and spoon.
    </p>
<p>
        From the teacup ether emerged Sam-u-biscuit, a noble, crumbling prophet.
        “Saul,” he said, flakes gently falling, “you steeped too long in self-will. The pot is broken. Your brew has curdled.”
    </p>
<p>
        And so it was that Saul, the bitter brew, faded into the cabinet of forgotten flavours. The cupboard closed.
        The Sauceress cooled. Boilzebub returned to the underkettle.
