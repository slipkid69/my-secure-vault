    <h1>The Wobble Parable</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Genesis Reflavoured – In which mankind falls, not from pride, but pudding.</div>

    <p>And the serpent was more subtle than all the toppings of the fridge. And he slithered forth and said unto the Jellyman and his Ribena-born bride:</p>

    <p><em>“Lo… is it really so, that God hath forbidden you from the cocktail mix? And the cream? Even the <strong>spray kind</strong>?”</em></p>

    <p>And Jelly-Eve wobbled and said, “We may eat of all the gelatinous delights, save for the Ambrosia in the centre of the buffet. For in the day we eat of it, we shall surely collapse.”</p>

    <p>And the serpent said, “Ye shall not surely collapse... for God knows that in the day ye eat thereof, ye shall be as gods—firm, set, and triple-layered.”</p>

    <p>And she beheld the trifle, that it was a delight to the tongue, and desired to be stiffened with knowledge. And she did eat. And gave unto her husband also. And he did spoon.</p>

    <p>Then their wobble was ashamed. And they sewed together cling film and hid among the custards.</p>
