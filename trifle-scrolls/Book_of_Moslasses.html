    <h1>The Book of Moslasses</h1>
    <h2>Crumbs in the Wilderness</h2>

    <p>In the time of Pharaoh Puddingtop, the Gingerbread Host suffered under the lash of fondant chains and candy-cane spears. But Moslasses, raised among pharaohs and bakers, was chosen to lead his people out of dessert oppression.</p>

    <p>With MacAaroon his brother, wielder of the sacred Spatula of Swirl, they brought plagues upon Egypt: sour milk, raining jellybeans, and frogs made of matcha sponge. Yet Pharaoh’s heart, both hard and creamy, refused to yield.</p>

    <p>Then came the Sugarseal. The Lord Baker commanded the Host to mark their doors with berry reduction, and the Angel of Dessolution passed over them, sparing their first frostings. In mourning and crumbled pride, Pharaoh let them go.</p>

    <p>But soon he gave chase, and the people came to the Red Jam Sea. Moslasses raised his spatula, and the sea parted with a mighty squelch. The Host passed through on shortbread ground. But Pharaoh’s caramel chariots followed... and were devoured by a raspberry collapse.</p>

    <p>On the far shore, the people danced in sprinkle dust and declared, “This is the day the Lord Baker has baked!” And so began the journey into the Sweetlands, under the gaze of the Whisked Flame.</p>

    <h2>Selah. And pass the spoon.</h2>
