        <h1>The True Majesty of King Solomon</h1>
        <p>King Solomon, son of David and chosen by the Most High, was not merely a ruler of Israel but a sacred steward of divine wisdom. His throne was not built by sorcery, but by obedience, understanding, and the gift of discernment bestowed by God. His temple was not a house for idols, but a dwelling for the Living God.</p>

        <h2>Divine Wisdom and Honour</h2>
        <p>Solomon's wisdom surpassed all the sages of the East and the magicians of Egypt—not because he invoked hidden powers, but because he sought the LORD above all else. The world brought gifts to his gates, not for incantations, but because his words reflected heaven’s truth.</p>

        <h2>The Garments of Glory</h2>
        <p>Clothed in royal robes of purple and gold, Solomon bore the colours of divine kingship: <strong>purple for majesty, gold for glory, white for righteousness</strong>. These were not the hues of alchemy or deception, but of holy appointment.</p>

        <h2>The Counterfeit Solomon</h2>
        <p>In later centuries, those estranged from truth forged lies in his name—claiming he commanded demons, that he trafficked in occult knowledge. These are distortions. The true Solomon served God, not darkness. The “Keys of Solomon,” “Goetia,” and similar writings are impostures—fabrications to clothe witchcraft in stolen majesty.</p>

        <h2>The Real Legacy</h2>
        <p>The real legacy of Solomon is his prayer at the dedication of the Temple. His cry was for forgiveness, for justice, for remembrance, and for the LORD’s name to be praised among the nations. Let us honour him not by echoing the sorcerers, but by proclaiming the splendour of the one who said: “Give your servant an understanding heart.”</p>

        <div class="footer">Let the name of Solomon be redeemed. Let truth stand, and distortion fall.</div>
